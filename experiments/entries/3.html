<h2>Betrock</h2>
This project started out in Python, as a simple script that managed to extract the Block data from the .mcr files.
These binaries containing the block Ids were then loaded into Godot, where they could be visualized.
However, due to my complete lack of knowledge in Godot and how to handle Voxels, it ran awfully.

The only obvious solution is to <del>improve performance in Godot</del> <b>REWRITE EVERYTHING IN C++ AND RENDER IT DIRECTLY IN OPENGL</b>.

<h3>Are you insane?</h3>
Well, this naive assumption that just because whatever I'd make would be written in C++ would make it run good was rooted in my assumed great understanding of C-like languages.
Unfortunately, it turns out, C++ is more than just C with objects, especially if you're trying to work without going mad.

My main spark to try my hand at this came after running Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 on my Raspberry Pi 3, and barely getting 5FPS. I figured it was Javas fault, and that was enough for me to jump into this project.

<h3>OpenGL and you</h3>
"Why OpenGL?", you may ask. Simple. I didn't want to deal with the intricacies of Vulkan as my first graphics programming experience.

<h3>The beginnngs</h3>
This section will be rather brief. It took me a while to figure out how vertex indicies and shaders worked before I could start rendering blocks in arbitrary places.

Struggling with OpenGL and the remnants of the .obj importer I had originally written for my MS-DOS model viewer.

Yes, that is the same goat model I used in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQSs0vAhhDc">goate</a>.

<h3>The horrors of meshing</h3>
After some hacking, I managed to render my first chunk.

I was rather proud of it at the time. I had even implemented a simple optimization where blocks that were surrounded on all sides would not be rendered!
</br>
With that, I added textures.

<p>After this I began making individual block models, so stuff like Grass would have properly aligned faces.</p>
<p>This was followed by trying to load in and render the block-based lighting properly.</p>
<p>Turns out the block-light describes how surrounding faces are supposed to be shaded.</p>
<p>For smooth lighting, simply check at each vertex which of the surrounding 4 blocks has the brightest light values.</p>

<p>I then added queued Chunk generation</p>

<p>I then multi-threaded this</p>

<p>More fixes!</p>

<p>Much more accurate lighting</p>

<p>And lastly Concurrent Chunk Loading</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot from a recent version of Betrock.</p>

<p>A big issue I've got right now is that chunks like to just infinitely leak memory.</p>
<p>Additionally, chunk building is abysmally slow.</p>
