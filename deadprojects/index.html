		This page exists to act as a graveyard of all of my fully dead projects,
		ones I either will never ever continue no matter what, or ones I deem unlikely to be
		revived unless something drastic happens.
		<br>
		<br>
		The list will only focus on projects I had high hopes for or that were
		objectively quite important to my life or career.
		<br>
		Most small-scale experiments are left out due to this, but also because
		there'd be too many entires to consider.
